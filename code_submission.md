Code Submission Guidelines
==========================

1. Review the issue and verify your solution covers all aspects of the new feature or fully resolves the problem it intends to fix.

1. If your feature branch is stale, rebase it against the base branch.

1. Make sure all tests and analyzers pass locally.

1. Squash all of your commits into one.  If it's important leave multiple commits in the pull request, make a case for that.
    * Use commit messages that accurately and concisely describe the change.
    * If the commit message is longer than 50 characters, use multi-line commit messages.

1. Push your branch up to GitHub and create a pull request.
    * State which issue(s) are resolved by this change (e.g. "Fixes #1234").
    * Make sure all checks pass on Travis.
